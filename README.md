# Portainer CE code

Portainer Stack Code

This code is for sharing with appropriate people who can help me debug code and sort issues

Ghost has a number of them at the moment which is why the stack is listed
I might list other stacks as I go along

I am not published the appropriate env files.  These files basically contain the sensitive data required to deploy the stack 
such as passwords, usernames and the like.  At the moment I prefer this method over docker secrets.
